The explaination goes back to the Modern Evolution theory given by Charles Darwin,Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and other prominent scientists.So
it can be safely believed that the theory can answer this question too.It is believed that all the multi-celled organisms eventually sprouted
from the single-celled organisms through various mutations and evolved into what they are today.These evolutions made them fit to survive 
in their habitats.My conclusion would be that at the through this process their would have once occured a deformity in premordial reptiles
that through slow and steady mutations they might have lead to an egg which gave birth to the modern chicken we see through today.
